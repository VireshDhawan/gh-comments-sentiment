[Github commit comments](https://github.com/blog/42-commit-comments) allow developers to express opinions about modifications of a code. The comments data were obtained from the [BigQuery Github Archive](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/github) and the sentiment analysis on them has been conducted with a help of Google Natural Language API. ~80K [comments sample](gh-comment-sentiment.csv)(~10K comments for each programming language) had been used to rank programming languages by a percentage of positive/negative comments. Here is the result, [built](draw_plot.R) with R.
